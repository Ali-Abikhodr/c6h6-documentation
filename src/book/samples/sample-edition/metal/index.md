## Drawing metal complexes

The chemical structure editor (openchemlib) allows to draw metallic bond. In order to draw a 'zero order' bond you need to first draw a single bond between an atom and a metal. With the single bond drawing tool selected you can then click on the bond couple of times in order to get the dotted bond.
