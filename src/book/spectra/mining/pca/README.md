# Calculate PCA for spectra

While superimposing spectra allows to check differences between 2 or 3 experiments it become tedious to compare a large set of data.

Many data mining algorithms my help in those cases and here we propose to analyse the data using PCA.

One of the problem may be the size of the data. This program is expected to deal with couple of hundreds spectra having up to 2048 points.

The workflow is the following:

- Select samples and add spectra
- Preprocess the spectrum
- Calculate a reduced size spectrum based on criteria
- Analyse the data
