# Compare a bunch of spectra

Multiple spectra analysis allows to quickly extract information about a set of spectra.

## Data normalization and previsualization

The first step is to select the spectra and you may follow this [tutorial](../common/selection/README.md)

Once spectra have been selected, data normalization filters can be applied and [more information is available here](../common/normalization/README.md).

The superimposed spectra can be manipulated without numerous [advanced features described here](../common/visualization/README.md).
