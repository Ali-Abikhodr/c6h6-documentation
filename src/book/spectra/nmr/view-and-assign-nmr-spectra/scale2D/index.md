## Vertical scaling of 2D spectra

It is possible to vertical scale 2D spectra with the scroll wheel.

By default positive and negative spectra are scaled separately.

If you want to scale the positive part of the spectrum you may scroll the wheel.

In order to scroll the negative part, press SHIFT and then scroll the wheel.
