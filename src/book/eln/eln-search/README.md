## Search reactions by structure

Choose filter group options:

- `all` searches in all the reactions you have access to
- `mine` searches in all reactions you have created
- search for a specific group to which you belong.

Select if you would like to search for a reagent or a product.

Draw a structure in the left module.

Choose between two Search modes:

- substructure: search for samples containing the given substructure
- similarity: search for samples with a similar structure.

The center module displays the list of matching structures. Select the one you want.
The right module displays the list of samples associated with the selected structure. Double clicking a row will take you back to the main tab, with the corresponding sample selected in the List of selected samples.

Double clicking a row in the center module will take you directly to the first matching sample.

Structure search uses the algorithm implemented in DataWarrior. They are open source and available as part of openchemlib (https://github.com/actelion/openchemlib, https://github.com/cheminfo/openchemlib-js).
