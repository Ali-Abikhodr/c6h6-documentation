## Specify the purity in mM

While the purity can be specified in many units (see below) it is also now possible to specify as `mM` (millimolar).

The purity of a reagent can also be specified using:

- `%`: purity as mass ratio
  - like 40% HNMe2 in water
- `M`: mole/liter
  - like 1.6M BuLi
- `L`: loading: mole/kg
  - useful for solid phase synthesis
