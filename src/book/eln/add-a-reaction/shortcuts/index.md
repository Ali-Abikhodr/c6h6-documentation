## Quickly edit procedure using shortcuts

It is possible to define an unlimited number of shortcuts. Shortcuts are defined as a key that corresponds to a text to be replaced.

In order to add the text in the procedure you can double click on the corresponding shortcut.

There is however much simpler, in the editor simply type the `key` and it will be immediately replaced by the corresponding text. In this example we enter `wus` followed by a space.
