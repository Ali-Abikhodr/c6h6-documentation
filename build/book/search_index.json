https://youtu.be/4UBwnFCBlvU\n\nwww.c6h6.org user guide\nYou may think of c6h6.org as either a Laboratory Information Management System or as a repository for your spectroscopic data (NMR, IR; MS) with some helpful tools (e.g. peak-picking, simulation).\nThis open source project is powered by cheminfo.org.\nHow to use it\nTo store your samples you must first login with your google account (upper-right corner). Public samples are available without login.\nCreate a sample:\nClick on Add Sample. You will be prompted to a form requiring a Reference code and a Batch code. These codes combine to produce the unique Product reference that identifies the sample in the List of selected samples. We suggest that you use the first code to denote the process generating the material from which the sample was collected (e.g. a Reaction) and the second to denote the Fraction that conformed the sample analyzed (e.g. a distillation fraction). Alternatively you may just input an appropriate Reference code to identify the sample (e.g. a CAS registry number) and ignore the Batch code altogether.\nFill in the form and click Submit. A new line is created in the List of selected samples and you are prompted to the Edit sample tab, where you can input your data.\nBrowse your samples:\nTo the left you will find the List of selected samples. The following information is available:\n\nProduct reference: the sample’s unique identifier\nLast modif.: Last modification date\nStructure: Chemical structure associated with the sample\nnb 1d: Number of 1D NMR spectra stored for the sample\nnb 2d: Number of 2D NMR spectra\nnb ms: Number of mass spectra\nnb IR: Number of infrared spectra\n\nSwitch the group* filter to either browse all samples you have access to (including public samples) or just your own (mine). Scroll down the List of selected samples and select the sample you want, or locate it with the Search for samples tool just above the list. There is also a Structure search tool where you can search samples by substructure or structure similarity.\nClick on a sample to select it. You may now use the tool set to your right to pick peaks, simulate spectra and more. Double clicking a sample takes you directly to the Open/edit sample tab.\nTool set:\nTo the right of the List of selected samples you find the tool set. Clicking on a tool icon will take you to a new tab where you can perform additional tasks:\nStructure search: Draw a chemical structure and search for samples that match it exactly, that are similar to it, or that contain it as a substructure.\nOpen/Edit sample: Input, upload, and edit the selected sample’s data.\n1D NMR peak-picking: Manage peak-picking of your 1D spectra. Generates a publication-ready list of peaks. Includes an automatic peak-picking tool to help you get started.\nOverlay NMR: Superimpose up to three NMR spectra from your database or from a local file. This tool is available with no sample selected.\nNMR predict: Predict and simulate 1H, 13C, COSY and HMBC spectra using state-of-the-art algorithms. You may also overlay the experimental spectrum with the prediction (1D only).\n"},"samples/substructure-search.html":{"url":"samples/substructure-search.html","title":"Structure search","keywords":"","body":"Structure search\n\nChoose filter group options: all searches in all structures, mine searches only entries that you have created.\nDraw a structure in the left module.\nChoose between three Search modes:\nsubstructure: search for samples containing the given substructure\nexact:  search for exact matches of the structure\nsimilarity: search for samples with a similar structure.\n\n\nThe center module  displays the list of matching structures. Select the one you want.\nThe right module displays the list of samples associated with the selected structure. Double clicking a row will take you back to the main tab, with the corresponding sample selected in the List of selected samples.\nDouble clicking a row in the center module will take you directly to the first matching sample.\n\nStructure search uses the same algorithms implemented in Datawarrior. They are open source and available as part of openchemlib (https://github.com/actelion/openchemlib, https://github.com/cheminfo/openchemlib-js).

Select one line to plot the corresponding NMR spectrum. We recommend you start from our Auto peak-picking. You will see the detected Ranges and their integrals just to the right of the spectrum. Select a range to see a list of the associated Signals with their multiplicities and coupling constants. Adjust the table values according to your own criterion. Use the J edition table to modify the multiplicity and coupling constants. A publication-ready report of your peak picking is automatically generated below the Spectra table. Don’t forget to Save your changes.  \nIntegration is automatically computed upon defining the corresponding range and cannot be edited manually. You may edit the Pub int column on the Ranges table to fine-tune the integral values in the report.  \nTo assign a peak select a range in the Ranges table and then select the nuclei to be assigned in the Structure. An icon appears in the last column of the Ranges table showing that the peak has been assigned; click that icon to remove the assignment. Assigned nuclei are highlighted whenever the corresponding peak is selected in the NMR spectrum.  \n"},"spectra/nmr/superimposition.html":{"url":"spectra/nmr/superimposition.html","title":"Superimposition","keywords":"","body":"Superimposition\nThis view allows to superimpose 1D and 2D spectra.\nSelect a sample from the List of selected samples.

Go to the row of your interest and click on either the Red, the Blue or the Green column to have the corresponding spectrum plotted in the chosen color. Choose a different spectrum (it may be from a different sample) and a different color to plot it superimposed over the first one. You may have up to three 1D and three 2D spectra superimposed.\nExclusion of some ranges\nIt is possible to exclude some ranges of the spectra in order to compare them more easily.

The current supported options are:\nRange: the spectra resulting from the merge of merge all the spectra between the beginning and end of the peak.\nMean: the mass spectra with a retention time equal to the mean value between the beginning and end of the peak.\nStart: the mass spectra with a retention time equal to the beginning of the peak.\nEnd: the mass spectra with a retention time equal to the end of the peak.\n\n\nFilter by median: the values under the median of the intensities times this parameter are removed.\nPercentage of the base peak: the values under the percentage (between 0-1) of the maximum intensity are removed.\nAlgorithm to merge: the algorithm of how to merge two masses and their respective intensities. The current supported algorithms are:\nCentroid: if the distances between the masses is below a parameter, the intensities are added and the mass is weighted to be closer to the most intense original peak.\nSlot: the masses are rounded using a parameter, and if in the rounding step the value is the same the intensities are added.\n\n\nMerge parameter: this is the distance parameter used in the previous merge algorithm.\nWidth to group: all the values that are at least at this distance in their masses are going to be considered part of the same multiplet.\n\nThe current selected monoisotopic mass is selected from the most intense value in the multiplet with a highest mass. This value can be changed doing Shift + Click over the mass spectra. This will select the closest peak in the mass spectrogram.\nMolecular formula prediction\nThe result of the peak selection on mass spectrometry allows to have an experimental monoisotopic mass that will be matched against a set of possible molecular formulas. This process is controlled by the options:\n\n\nModification: how was charged the molecule. Most of the time the value should be H+.\nRange: List of elements followed by their respective range of possibles values, separated between the elements by a space.\nPrecision (ppm): maximum absolute error allowed in ppm. This will have a big impact on speed so be as precise as possible !\nUnsaturation filters:\nUse unsaturation: use unsaturation as a filter method.\nMin unsaturation: minimum allowed value for the saturation.\nMax unsaturation: maximum allowed value for the saturation.\nInteger unsaturation: allows only integer results for the saturation values. This option should not be used when the molecule was charged with a proton.\n\n\nSimilarity: This will calculate a similarity between the theoretical isotopic distribution and the experimental one. The matching algorithm will consider that each theoretical peak is an isosceles trapezoid with a defined width of the top that should be around the precision of the instrument and the bottom that may be 2 or 3 times the precision. It is expressed in Dalton. You need also  to specify the range that will be used to compare the isotopic distribution. For small molecules a value between -0.5 and 2.5 is appropriate. This means that the window compared will be between the monoisotopic mass -0.5 to the monoisotopic mass +2.5.\nWidth bottom: width in Daltonof the bottom of the isosceles trapezoid used to match the theoretical spectrum to the experimental spectrum. A good value is 3 times the precision..\nWidth top: width in Dalton of the top of the isosceles trapezoid used to match the theoretical spectrum to the experimental spectrum. A good value is half the precision.\nDalton before: number of Dalton under the monoisotopic mass that define the window used to calculate the similarity between experimental and theoretical isotopic distribution.\nDalton after: number of Dalton over the monoisotopic mass that define the window used to calculate the similarity between experimental and theoretical isotopic distribution.\n\n\n\nThese options, combined with the result of the monoisotopic mass, will generate a list of possible molecular formulas. In this list is shown the molecular formula, the theoric monoisotopic mass, the unsaturation and the error in ppm with the experimental monoisotopic mass. When a row is clicked, the simulated mass spectrometry is overlapped in the mass spectrometry of the compound. There is also a zoom action, that allows to zoom in the region where the simulated mass spectrometry is located.  \n"},"epfl/epfl-private-tools.html":{"url":"epfl/epfl-private-tools.html","title":"EPFL private tools","keywords":"","body":"EPFL private tools\nYou may think of eln.epfl.ch as either an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) or as a repository for your spectroscopic data (NMR, IR; MS) with some helpful tools (e.g. peak-picking, simulation).\nCheck our youtube video:\n\nGeneral introduction about the website: https://youtu.be/SHN07asZaGc\nAdding new products: https://youtu.be/4UBwnFCBlvU\n\nQuick tip : How to generate a sample submission form\nAdd a sample\n\nClick on “Add a sample”\nEnter the name of the sample (and the batch if needed)\nIn the sample page, you can either draw the structure of your compound, or click right on the drawing box and Copy a structure as a MOL (drag and drop a .mol file from your computer) or smiles or sdf file.\nSave and go back to home page\n\nGenerate a sample submisson form\n\nSelect the sample\nClick on “Mass requests” or “Xray requests”\nFill the form and click on ‘Create and print request’\n\nMore detailed information about eln.epfl.ch\nCreate a sample:\nClick on Add Sample.

An alternative way to add a spiro ring (that may be used also on touch devices) is to press the icon; the next ring will be then added as spiro.With single bond selected, a click on existing single bond changes it to double.With the powerful chain tool  you can draw chains, saturated rings and by clicking on single bond change it to a double bond.Molecule may be moved by \"dragging\" free space and rotated by pressing also the Shift key.  \nJSME Keyboard Shortcuts\nIf you are using JSME often, learn the following shortcuts. They will speed-up your editing considerably.\nESC returns to the standard editing state (carbon, single bond)d or Del starts delete modeatoms C, N, O, P, S, F, L (for Cl), B (for Br), I, H, Rbonds - for single bond, = for double bondrings 3..8 for 3 to 8 membered rings, 1 for phenyl and 0 for furylgroups a - COOH, y - NO2, z - SO3H, t - tert. butyl, ft - CF3\nStereochemistry\nStereochemistry at C4 centers, double bonds and allenes is supported. Use the up / down wedge bonds to indicate stereochemistry at the C4 centers. Remember, that only bonds with a \"sharp point\" towards the atom are considered. When creating SMILES the editor tries to guess missing stereo features, in unresolvable cases an error message is issued and the SMILES without stereo information is created.When the \"autoez\" option is set, SMILES with E,Z stereochemistry on all non-ring double bonds will be generated automatically. Without this keyword (or for ring double bonds) you have to mark a double bond as stereo by clicking on it with the stereo bond button selected. The bond color will change to magenta.Stereochemistry may be completely disabled by the \"nostereo\" option.\nAtom Numbering\nAtom numbering (marking) is enabled by the option \"number\" (for reaction input this is default). Button  appears in the menu. To mark an atom the \"numbering mode\" must be on, selected by clicking the 123 button. The atom number is chosen by pressing respective keys on your keyboard (i.e. 2 or 12); then atom(s) must be clicked. To delete the number pres 0 at your keyboard and then click the atom.\nInput of Multipart Structures\nBy default only non-disconnected structures may be entered. This may be changed by a \"multipart\" option. A button appears in the menu. A new molecule may be started only after clicking this button, then selecting a proper template (atom, ring or bond) and clicking free space in the drawing area. Without clicking the NEW button first clicking the free space has the same effect as in the standard mode (i.e moving or rotation of the last touched molecule). In the multipart mode the  button deletes the last touched molecule.\nReaction Input\nReaction input is enabled with the option \"reaction\". Buttons ,  and  appear in the menu and arrow appears also in the drawing area. Now simply draw reactant(s), product(s) and modulator(s) (modulators have to be above the arrow) as explained in the description of input of multipart structures. The arrow button enables simplified input of reactions. After clicking it, the reactant will be copied to the product (including atom numbering, if any).\nQuery Features\nQuery button  (when enabled in the options) launches a query window that allows creation of SMARTS atom or bond queries by combining various atom attributes.

Thus, the atom mapping tool is only available, when a reaction is edited. Query feature dialogs only open, when a substructure is edited, etc.  \nAtom and Bond Hot-Keys\nHot-keys allow to quickly change atom and bond types. When the mouse is moved over an atom or bond then the atom or bond is automatically highlighted, indicating that mouse clicks or pressing a hot-key affect the highlighted object.\n\n\n\nHot-Key\nType\nName\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n'Delete'\nAtoms Bonds Mapping\nDelete\nDeletes highlighted and selected atoms and bonds.

While the selection of a tool has no immidiate effect on the drawn structure, pressing a button does. Currently available buttons allow to clean up atom coordinates or to revert the most recent structure change.\n\n\n\nButton or Tool\nName\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\nAtom Tools\nThe Atom Tools cover atoms frequently used in organic chemistry. After selecting one of these tools, you may place new atoms by clicking into the empty space or change existing atom by clicking onto them.\n\n\n\nAtom Detail Tool\nDouble clicking an atom with this tool selected will open a dialog window for specifying an unusual atom label, specific isotop, abnormal valence and/or radical state. When closing the dialog the double clicked atom is changed accordingly. The dialog settings are remembered applied to any other clicked atom, as long as the tool is selected.\n\n\n\nCharge Tools\nThese tools let you assign charges to atoms. Multiple clicks on the same atom will increase or decrease the charge by 1. The Osiris Structure Editor assumes the presence of implicit hydrogens at any charged or non charged atoms to meet the atom's default valence. However, implicit hydrogens are only shown on hetero atoms.\n\n\n\nRing Tools\nAfter selecting one of the predefined rings, one may create a new ring or attach a ring to an existing bond or atom to create annelated ring systems or a spiro compound, respectively.\n\n\n\nBond Tools\nBond Tools allow you to create new bonds and to change existing bonds concerning their order or stereo-orientation. By clicking into the open space you create a new bond of the selected type including two carbon atoms. Clicking onto an existing atom will attach a new carbon. Dragging the mouse from one atom to another one will just connect these atoms or increment the bond order between them, if they were already connected. If the plain single bond tool is selected, bonds may be multiply clicked to cycle through the possible bond orders. Where reasonable, it also toggles between double bonds with known or unknown configuration, the so-called cross bond. When using stereo bonds please consider that the pointed tip of the bond should always point to the stereo center.\n\n\n\nChain Tool\nThe Chain Tool provides the fastest way to draw aliphatic carbon chains in zig-zag orientation. With the selected Chain Tool click into the empty space or at an existing atom and drag the mouse to create a new zig-zag chain and flip its orientation.\n\n\n\nESR Tools\nThe editor supports the enhanced stereo recognition (ESR) introduced by Molecular Design Ltd. with IsisDraw V2.5. The ESR Tools allow to define for every stereo center, whether it is an absolute one or if it belongs to a group of stereo centers that have the drawn, but relative configuration. For any group of relative stereo centers one may define that the drawn and the inverse configurations are present, i.e. that we have a racemic situation concerning the group members. This is indicated by green stereo bonds and an ampersand '&' at the stereo centers. Likewise one may define groups of relative stereo centers that contain either the drawn configuration or the opposite one. Stereo centers of such a group are indicated by blue stereo bonds and the word 'or' at the stereo centers. In addition to the '&' or 'or' indicators group numbers show which stereo centers belong to the same group.\n\n\n\nUnknown Configuration Tool\nThis symbol is used to denote an unknown stereo configuration at a chiral center.\n\n\n\nCleanup Button\nA cleanup will generate new coordinates of an existing molecule. It rearranges bond and atom positions in order to have a proper 2D structure. If a part of the molecule or reaction is selected, the cleanup will retain the relative orientation of the non-selected atoms.\n\n\n\nLasso Pointer Tool\nThis tools allows you to select multiple atoms and bonds to rearrange, rotate, resize, delete or duplicate at the same time. Just drag the mouse pointer around the atoms of interest. Selected atoms and bonds are shown in red. By pressing the control key you switch to the rectangular selection mode and the shift key lets you add atoms to the current selection. By clicking onto an atom or bonds and dragging the mouse one may more it or all selected atoms, if the clicked one is selected. When pressing the shift key while dragging a selected fragment, an automatically created copy of the selected fragment is dragged. Where the editor needs to support multiple molecules, e.g. if a reaction is edited, then every reactant and product is indicated by a large light gray indicator in the background ('A', 'B', 'P1', etc.). Where independent fragments shall be treated as one molecule, e.g. anion and kation of one salt, one must locate those fragments close enough that there is only one indicator behind them. If a reaction or molecule query is edited, then one may double click an atom or a set of selected atoms to open a query feature dialog to specify additional conditions for a fragment to match in a substructure search. The same applies to individual or multiple selected bonds. If the edited object is not a query then double clicking of an atom or bond will just select the entire fragment.\n\n\n\nDelete Tool\nIt allows you to delete individual atoms or bonds or selected parts of the molecule. Selected areas may also be removed by pressing the delete key from the keyboard.\n\n\n\nZoom and Rotate Tool\nThis tool allows to zoom or rotate the entire drawing or a selected subset. Just click at the intended origin for the rotation or zooming and drag the mouse vertically to zoom or horizontically to rotate.\n\n\n\nMapping Tool\nThis tool is only available when a reaction is edited. Use this tool to map reactant atoms to the respective product atoms. This is done by clicking on a reactant atom and dragging the mouse onto the corresponding product atom. The editor will acknowledge the link by displaying a red mapping number at both atoms. Afterwards it tries to map atoms in the vicinity automatically and displays green numbers at automatically mapped atoms. Please assign manually as many reactant-product pairs as are needed that the entire reaction is mapped completely and correctly. Pressing the 'Delete' key while this tool is selected removes all mapping from the reaction.\n\n\n\nText Tool\nThe text tool may only be selected in certain situations. If it is selected one may use it to place text elements directly into the drawing. These text elements will be integral part of the drawing and, thus, move, resize and rotate with the molecules or reaction.\n\n\n\n"},"tools/science/chemistry/ocl-editor/stereo/":{"url":"tools/science/chemistry/ocl-editor/stereo/","title":"Stereochemistry","keywords":"","body":"Stereochemistry and openchemlib editor\nStereochemistry in organic chemistry is a complex problem.
